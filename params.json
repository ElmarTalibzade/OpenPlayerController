E.g, if you don't want your player to jump in your game/level, simply remove the script and OPC will do the rest.\r\n\r\n<br><br><i>The project has started on 30 August 2016.</i>\r\n\r\n##Why does this project exist?\r\n<br>While the new RigidBody based Character Controller developed by Unity is a good, its codebase is too complex and there are sometimes features that developer doesn't need (e.g mobile input)\r\n<br>Sure there are some good alternatives out there on the Asset Store, but they're costly and, to some extent, are complex too. <br><br>OPC is aimed to be used by beginner/professional indie developers who want to create a quick prototype for their games in Unity Engine.\r\n\r\n##How can I help this project?\r\nOpen Player Controller is an open source project. \r\nFork it as your own repository to make any modifications you want. Let's make OPC better together for everyone!\r\n<br><br>\r\nYou're free to retain them and use for both commercial and non-commercial purposes (apart from directly selling scripts). \r\n<br><br>OPC is licensed under <a href=\"https://github.com/elmar1235/OpenPlayerController/blob/master/LICENSE.md\" target+\"_blank\">MIT License</a>.\r\n\r\n#Features\r\nOpen Player Controller is currently is in active development (as of August 2016) with current  subject to alteration and implementation of future ones.\r\n<br>For most up-to-date features, take a look at a <a href=\"https://trello.com/b/GXjWg5oO\" target+\"_blank\">Trello Board</a>.\r\n\r\n##Current Features (2 September 2016)\r\n* RigidBody based Player Locomotion\r\n* Push other RigidBody objects with Player's mass\r\n* Crouching - player can crouch underneath low objects by holding down Left Control button. Player's camera, and its collider, and movement speed, react to crouching\r\n* Jumping (incomplete) - player can jump around\r\n* * Climbing Ladders (experimental)\r\n\r\n##Planned Features\r\n* Player Prone\r\n* Walking on Stairs without any need of an invisible ramp\r\n* Swimming\r\n* React to falling from high places (e.g fall damage)\r\n* React to being crushed by a RigidBody Object taking its mass into consideration\r\n* React to having a RigidBody Object thrown at taking its mass into consideration\r\n* Many more planned (Third Person Shooter Player Controller?)\r\n\r\n#How to get Started?\r\n\r\n##Implementing Open Player Controller into Unity Project\r\n\r\nThis can be done by simply navigating to the \"Prefabs\" folder, where you can find a FPS Player Controller and dragging it into the scene.\r\n<br><br>And that's pretty much it!\r\n\r\n##Collaboration on a project\r\nEnsure that edited/added code is well commented before doing pull requests\r\n",
