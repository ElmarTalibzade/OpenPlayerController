<p>Open Player Controller (OPC for short) is an open source Character Controller that makes a use of RigidBodies to move player around the scene.
<br>Built from the ground up with C#, OPC is a flexible character system which can be inmplemented into any type of project (FPS only currently).
<br>Its Modular system is one of the biggest perks. E.g, if you don't want your player to jump in your game/level, simply remove the script and OPC will do the rest.</p>

<p><br><br><i>The project has started on 30 August 2016.</i></p>

<a id="why-does-this-project-exist" class="anchor" href="#why-does-this-project-exist" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why does this project exist?</h2>

<p><br>While the new RigidBody based Character Controller developed by Unity is a good, its codebase is too complex and there are sometimes features that developer doesn't need (e.g mobile input)
<br>Sure there are some good alternatives out there on the Asset Store, but they're costly and, to some extent, are complex too. <br><br>OPC is aimed to be used by beginner/professional indie developers who want to create a quick prototype for their games in Unity Engine.</p>

<p>Open Player Controller is an open source project. 
Fork it as your own repository to make any modifications you want. Let's make OPC better together for everyone!
<br><br>
You're free to retain them and use for both commercial and non-commercial purposes (apart from directly selling scripts). 
<br><br>OPC is licensed under <a href="https://github.com/elmar1235/OpenPlayerController/blob/master/LICENSE.md">MIT License</a>.</p>

<p>Open Player Controller is currently is in active development (as of August 2016) with current  subject to alteration and implementation of future ones.
<br>For most up-to-date features, take a look at a <a href="https://trello.com/b/GXjWg5oO">Trello Board</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>RigidBody based Player Locomotion</li>
<li>Push other RigidBody objects with Player's mass</li>

<ul>
<li>Player Prone</li>
<li>Walking on Stairs without any need of an invisible ramp</li>
<li>Swimming</li>
<li>React to falling from high places (e.g fall damage)</li>
<li>React to being crushed by a RigidBody Object taking its mass into consideration</li>
<li>React to having a RigidBody Object thrown at taking its mass into consideration</li>
<li>Many more planned (Third Person Shooter Player Controller?)</li>

<p>This can be done by simply navigating to the "Prefabs" folder, where you can find a FPS Player Controller and dragging it into the scene.
<br><br>And that's pretty much it!</p>
